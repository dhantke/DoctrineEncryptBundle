#DoctrineEncryptBundle

This is a fork from [ambta/DoctrineEncryptBundle](https://github.com/ambta/DoctrineEncryptBundle).

Since _mcrypt_ was set deprecated for PHP 7.1 and removed for PHP 7.2 the [ambta/DoctrineEncryptBundle](https://github.com/ambta/DoctrineEncryptBundle) isn't compatible anymore.   

This bundle is using _the openSSL_ instead of _mcrypt_ for PHP 7.2 support.
